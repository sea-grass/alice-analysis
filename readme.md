exploring data interactivity and visualization using d3 and three.

Alice in Wonderland text from: [this site](http://www.umich.edu/~umfandsf/other/ebooks/alice30.txt)

Currently:
- lines are counted, with a line number being shown beside each line
- lines are searchable for exact text
- the story may be "progressed" by altering the bar on the slider (pretty rough though)


TODO:
  - move index.html from bin to src
  - think of more TODOs
